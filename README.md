## Introduction

This document offers a high-level overview of the **$PEPERONI Meme Coin Protocol** a deliciously decentralized experiment built on Solana, spiced with community vibes, and served hot to the culture.

Whether you're here to explore the meme, understand the mission, or just figure out why everyone’s talking about pizza on the blockchain, this paper is for you.

We're not promising world domination. We're just here to **build, vibe, and feed the ecosystem** one slice at a time.

## What is $PEPERONI?

It’s not just a coin. It’s not just a meme. $PEPERONI is a community payment token built to celebrate the people who make Web3 spicy creators, builders, and degens. It’s fast. It’s fair. It’s food-themed financial freedom. Distributed, delicious, and baked on Solana.

## Mission & Vibes

"Cooked by the People" What happens when you throw community, culture, and a little insanity into a Solana oven? You get $PEPERONI a decentralized memecoin that isn’t built on hype, but on **fun, fairness, and freedom**.

No tax scams. No VCs calling shots. Just a growing tribe of meme chefs baking something tastier than the usual crypto soup.

Built different:

- LP burned
- Ownership renounced
- Meme-first mission
- Permissionless utility layer on Solana

> It’s not just a vibe it’s a movement with mozzarella.

\newpage
## The Slice of Utility

Whether you're a builder, creator, degen, or just here for the sauce **$PEPERONI isn't just a memecoin, it’s a full-course utility token inside the world’s most flavorful Web3 experience**.

Built on **Solana** for blazing speed. Fueled by **community** and **creativity**. Designed to be **used**, not just held.

## Roadmap: The Oven’s Always On

Our roadmap isn’t bound by rigid timelines we build as the dough rises and the sauce simmers. Milestones unlock based on community growth, development readiness, and how spicy things get.

## Slicenomics

### Total Supply: **1,790,000,000 $PEPERONI**

Like any legendary pizza, it all starts with the dough and we’re baking it right.

### The Milestone Burn: 790,000,000 $PEPERONI (44.13%)

At launch, we’re firing up the oven and turning 790 million tokens into the “pizza dough”, the base layer of scarcity and flavor for the $PEPERONI ecosystem.

But we’re not tossing it all into the fire at once.

This dough will be baked in slices, with tokens burned progressively across 8 project milestones.
The earlier the milestone, the hotter the burn larger portions toasted upfront, with smaller slices burned as the project rises in adoption and utility.

## Disclaimer: No Promises, Just Peperonis

PEPERONI is a **meme coin**, created **for entertainment, culture, and community engagement** on the Solana blockchain. It is **not an investment**, **not a security**, and **not backed by any expectation of profit** from the efforts of others.

### Read This Before You Ape:

- $PEPERONI **does not represent ownership**, equity, dividends, or shares in any organization.
- There is **no VC**, and **no roadmap fixed time promises** only vibes and community-built ideas.
- We **renounce control** and distribute the token for **memetic and experimental purposes** only.
- Participation in the $PEPERONI ecosystem (including games, merch, or tools) is entirely **voluntary** and **for fun**.

### TL;DR:

If you’re looking for a guaranteed return, **this ain't it**. $PEPERONI is a spicy slice of internet culture, not financial advice, not a promise of gains.

> “We’re baking memes, not securities.”

## Community & Culture

At the heart of $PEPERONI is a community of **pizza-pilled memelords**, creators, degens, and builders united by one delicious mission:

**To bake the most valuable pizza the world has ever seen on-chain, together.**

We’re not here for empty hype or fake promises. We’re here for:

- **Vibes over valuations**
- **Utility disguised as memes**
- **Collective chaos with a sauce of vision**

\newpage
### How We Roll:

- **Meme-First Philosophy**  
  If it’s not fun, it’s not $PEPERONI. Our culture celebrates memes, jokes, internet absurdity, and the power of decentralized humor.
- **Creator-Backed Culture**  
  We support those who build. Whether you're launching your own coin, designing art, or creating spicy content, there’s a slice for you in this pizza shop.
- **No Team Worship. No Gods. Just Pizza.**  
  This isn’t about following a founder. It’s about baking something together with open wallets, open-source tools, and open minds.
- **Global, Weird & Proud**  
  Whether you’re in Tokyo, Texas, or Tegucigalpa if you’ve got the sauce, you’re one of us.

### What Makes Our Culture Stick:

- Burn together. Win together. The more we bake, the rarer $PEPERONI becomes.
- Participate in the ecosystem, earn perks, and flex your merch on the streets.
- Help spread the crust community memes, contests, games, and IRL activations.

> “We’re not just baking pizza. We’re baking culture one slice at a time.”

Thank you. $PEPERONI IS NOT FREE, BUT IT FEELS LIKE DELICIOUS FREEDOM!
